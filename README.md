Color Sequence Challenge:
  Simon game, a Color Sequence Challenge, is a classic electronic memory game where players need to repeat a sequence of colors or sounds. It typically consists of four colored buttons, each corresponding to a specific color and sound.

The game starts with a simple sequence, usually played by the device, where one button lights up or produces a sound. The player must then repeat the sequence by pressing the correct buttons in the same order. As the game progresses, the sequence becomes longer and more challenging, requiring players to have a good memory and focus.

The objective of the Simon game is to repeat the longest sequence correctly, earning points for each successful repetition. However, if the player makes a mistake and presses the wrong button or misses a button in the sequence, the game ends, and the player's score is displayed.

The game starts with four different colors: red, blue, green, and yellow. Your task is to match the computer's color sequence by clicking the corresponding colored buttons on the website.

With each level, the challenge becomes more complex. The computer generates a sequence of colors, and you need to replicate it accurately. For instance, if the first level displays a red color, you must click the red button to proceed. In subsequent levels, the computer highlights a random colored button, and you must remember and reproduce the sequence correctly to advance further.
