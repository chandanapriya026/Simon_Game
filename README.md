Color Sequence Challenge:
  Simon game, a Color Sequence Challenge, is a classic electronic memory game where players need to repeat a sequence of colors or sounds. It typically consists of four colored buttons, each corresponding to a specific color and sound.

The game starts with a simple sequence, usually played by the device, where one button lights up or produces a sound. The player must then repeat the sequence by pressing the correct buttons in the same order. As the game progresses, the sequence becomes longer and more challenging, requiring players to have a good memory and focus.

The objective of the Simon game is to repeat the longest sequence correctly, earning points for each successful repetition. However, if the player makes a mistake and presses the wrong button or misses a button in the sequence, the game ends, and the player's score is displayed.
